# Parking Spaces
This repo contains the code for the 'Parking spaces' microservice, which allows users to provide suggestions to add parking spaces to the app's list and, if enough suggestions are added, adds the parking spaces.

### Setup
If you're a user that wants to experience this app, you don't have to lift a finger, as the app is available [here](http://34.154.95.135:4200/).
However if you're a dev who wants to work on this app, simply rebase the main branch of the repo onto your own branch, import the project into IntelliJ IDEA and begin working.
